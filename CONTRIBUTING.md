## Dependencies Policy

Dependencies must be evaluated before being introduced to ensure they:

1) are actively maintained
2) are maintained by trustworthy maintainers

These evaluations vary from dependency to dependencies.

Dependencies are also scheduled for removal if that project has been deprecated or if the project is no longer maintained.
